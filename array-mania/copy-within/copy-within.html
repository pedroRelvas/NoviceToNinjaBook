		<h1>CopyWithin method</h1>
		<p>
			The copyWithin() method shallow copies part of an array to another
			location in the same array and returns it without modifying its length
		</p>
		<h3>Syntax</h3>
		<p>
			arr.copyWithin(target[, start[, end]])
		</p>
		<h3>Parameters</h3>
		<p>
			<b>target</b>Zero-based index at which to copy the sequence to. If
			negative, target will be counted from the end. If target is at or greater
			than arr.length, nothing will be copied. If target is positioned after
			start, the copied sequence will be trimmed to fit arr.length.
			<b>start</b>Zero-based index at which to start copying elements from. If
			negative, start will be counted from the end. If start is ommited,
			copyWithin will copy from index 0. <b>end</b>Zero-based index at which to
			end copying elements from copyWithin copies up to but not incuding end. If
			negative, end will be counted from the end. If end is ommited, copyWithin
			will copy until the last index.
