		<h1>Currying</h1>
		<p>
			Curying or partial application is the process of applying one argument at
			a time to a function. A new function is returned until all the arguments
			have been used.
		</p>
		<p>
			A function is said to be curried when not all arguments have been supplied
			to the function, so it returns another function that retains the arguments
			already provided, and expects the remaining arguments that were omitted
			when the original function was called. A final result is only returned
			once all the expected arguments have eventually been provided
		</p>
		<p>
			Currying relies on higher-order functions that are able to return
			partially applied functions. All curried functions are higher-order
			functions because they return a function, but not all higher function are
			curried.
		</p>
		<h1>A general curry function</h1>
		<p>
			It's possible to use a curry() function (see js file) to take any function
			and allow it to be partially applied.
