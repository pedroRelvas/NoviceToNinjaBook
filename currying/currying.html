      A function is said to be curried when not all arguments have been supplied
      to the function, so it returns another function that retains the arguments
      already provided, and expects the remaining arguments that were omitted
      when the original function was called. A final result is only returned
      once all the expected arguments have eventually been provided
    </p>
    <p>
      Currying relies on higher-order functions that are able to return
      partially applied functions. All curried functions are higher-order
      functions because they return a function, but not all higher function are
      curried.
