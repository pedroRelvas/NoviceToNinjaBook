			Object-oriented programming (OOP for short) is a style of programming that
			involves separating the code into objects that have properties and
			methods. This approach has the benefit of keeping related pieces of code
			encapsulated in objects that maintain state throughout the life of the
			program. The objects can also be reused or easily modified, as required.
			JavaScript obviously supports objects, as we saw in Chapter 5, so it also
			supports an object-oriented style of programming.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are 3 main concepts in OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism and
			inheritance.
		</p>
		<h3>Encapsulation</h3>
		<p>
			When I use my juicer. I put the fruit into the machine, press the "On"
			button and out comes the juice. I havn't a clue how it does it - only that
			it maes a very loud noise! This demonstrates the concept of encapsulation:
			the inner workings are kept hidden inside the object and only the
			essential functionalities are eposed t the end user, such as the "on"
			button. In OOP, this involves keeping all the programming logic inside an
			object and makng methods available to implement he functionality, without
			the outside world needing to know how it's done.
		</p>
		<h3>Polymorphism</h3>
		<p>
			My juicer isn't te only appliance I own that has an "on" button, although
			the way the on button works is slightly different for each appliance. My
			juicer also uses the same electrical outlet as other appliances in my
			kitchen. I can also place various types of fruit into it and it still
			juices them. These examples demonstrate the concept of polymorphism: the
			same process can be used for different objects. In OOP, this means various
			objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override
			shared methods with a more specific implementation.
		</p>
		<h3>Inheritance</h3>
		<p>
			I'd really like the next model up from my juicer, as it can deal with more
			types of fruit and it's a bit quieter. Even though it has these extra
			features, I'm sure that inside it uses many of the same parts that m
			juicer has. This demonstrates the concept of inheritance; taking the
			features of one object then adding some new features. In OPP, this means
			we can take an object already exists and inherit all its prperties and
			methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties
			and methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new
			properties and methods.
		</p>
		<h3>Classes</h3>
		<p>
			Many object-oriented languages, such as Java and Ruby, are known as
			class-based languages. This is because they use a class to define a
			blueprint for an object. Objects are then created as an instance of that
			class, and inherit all the propertes and methods of the class. In my
			juicer example, the juicer class would represent the design of the juicer,
			and each juicer that's made onthe production line would be instances of
			that class.
