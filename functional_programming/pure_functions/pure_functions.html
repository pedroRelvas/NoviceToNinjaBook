			Pure functions are functions that don't rely on the state of the code they
			are called from, have no side-effects, and always give the same result
			then gives the same arguments (referential transparency).
		</p>
		<p>
			A key aspect of functional programing is its use of pure functions. A pure
			function is a function that adheres to the following rules:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The return value of a pure function
				<b>should only depend on the values provided as arguments.</b> It
				doesn't rely on values from somewhere else in the program.
			</li>
			<li>
				There are no side-effects. A pure function
				<b>doesn't change any values or data elsewhere in the program</b>. It
				only makes non-destructive data transformations and returns new values,
				rather than altering any of the underlying data.
			</li>
			<li>
				Referential transparency. Given the same arguments, a pure function will
				always return the same result.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>In order to follow these rules, any pure function must have:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				At least one argument; otherwise the return value must depend on
				somethng other than the arguments of the function.
			</li>
			<li>
				A return value; otherwise there's no point n the function(unless it has
				changed something else in the program - in wich case it's broken the "no
				side effects" rule
			</li>
		</ul>
