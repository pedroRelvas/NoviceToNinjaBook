      Javascript has always supported functional-style programming due to
      function being first-class objects. The ability to pass funtion as
      arguments, return them from other functions, and use anonymous functions
      and closures, are all fundamental elements of functional programming that
      Javascript excels at.

      Functional programming is a programming paradigm. Other examples of
      programming paradigms include object oriented programming and procedural
      programming. Javascript is a multi-paradigm language, meaning that it can
      be used to program in a variety of paradigms (and sometimes a mash-up of
      them!). The flexibility is and attractive feature of the language, but it
      also makes it harder to adopt a particular coding style as the principles
      are not enforced by the language.
