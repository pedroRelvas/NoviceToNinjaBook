		<p>Using Promises</p>
		<h1>Forget this, see the mzdocumentian instead</h1>
		<p>
			A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of
			an asynchrnous operation. Since most people are consumers of
			already-reated promises, this guide will explain consumption of returned
			promises before explaining how to create them. Essentially,a promise is a
			returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing
			callbacks into a function. Imagine a function, createAudioFileAsync(),
			which asynchronously generates a sound file given a configuraton record
			and two callback functions, one called if the audo file is successfully
			created, and the other called if an error occurs.
		</p>
		<h2>Guarantees</h2>
		<p>
			Unlike "old-style", passed-in callbacks, a promise comes with some
			guarantees:/p>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Callbacks will never be called before completion of the current run of
				the JS event loop.
			</li>
			<li>
				Callbaks added with then() even after the success or failure of the
				asynchronous operation, will be called, as above.
			</li>
			<li>
				Multiple callbacks may be added by calling then() several times. Each
				callback is executed one after another, in the order in which they were
				inserted.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Chaining</h2>
		<p>
			ommon need is to eecute two or mor easynchronous operatons back to back,
			where each subsequent operation starts when the previous operation
			succeeds, with the result from the previous step. We accomplish this by
			creating a promise chain.
		</p>
		<script>
			//if createAudioFileAsync() were rewritte to return a promise, using it could be as simple as this:
			createAudioFileAsync(audioSetting).then(successCallback, failureCallback);
			//That's shorthand for:
			//We call this an asynchronous function call. This convention has several advantages.
			const promise = createAudioFileAsync(audioSettings);
			promise.then(sucessCallback, failureCallback);
			//With modern functions, we attach our callbacks to the returned promises instead, forming a promise chain:
			doSomething()
				.then(function(result) {
					return doSomethingElse(result);
				})
				.then(function(newResult) {
					return doThirdThing(newResult);
				})
				.then(function(finalResult) {
					console.log("Got the final result: " + finalResult);
				})
				.catch(failureCallback);
