		<p>Namespacing</p>
		<p>
			Naming collisions ccur when the same variable or function name is used for
			different purposes by code sharing the same scope.
		</p>
		<p>
			A solution to this problem is to use the object literal pattern to create
			a namespace for groups of related functions. This is done by creating an
			object literal that serve as the namespace, then adding any values as
			properties of that object, and any functions as methods.
