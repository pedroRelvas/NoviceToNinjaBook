    <p>Higher-Order Functions</p>
    <p>
      High-order functions are functions that accept another fucntion as an
      argument or return another function as a result, or both.
    </p>

    <p>
      Closures are used extensively in higher-order functions as they allow us
      to create a generic function that can be used to then return more specific
      functions based on its arguments, This is done by creating a closure
      around a function's arguments that keeps them "alive" in a return
      function.
    </p>

    <p>
      Higher-Order functions are one of the core tenets of functional
      programming: it allows generic higher order functions to be used to return
      more specific functions based on particular parameters.
